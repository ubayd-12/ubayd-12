# Hi, I'm Ubayd! 👋🏾

I'm a computer science student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with a passion for machine learning and fullstack development. I'm particularly interested in the ability to create applications that can reach millions of people and make a positive impact on their lives.

## **Technologies and Tools** 💻

I have experience working with a variety of technologies and tools, including:

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- C++
- ROS
- Python
- MongoDB
- Azure

I'm always eager to learn more about new technologies and frameworks, so I'm excited to see what other tools I can add to my toolkit.

## **Projects** 🚀

One of my favorite projects that I've worked on is a travel aggregator mock app. This app pulls data from various travel sites to provide users with a comprehensive list of flight and hotel options. I used ReactJS to build the front-end and Express to build the back-end, and I stored data in a MongoDB database. It was a great learning experience for me, and I'm proud of the final product.

## **Collaboration** 👥

I'm open to collaborating on any sort of web application, whether it's a small project or a large-scale application. I'm excited to work with others and learn from their experiences. If you have a project in mind or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at ubaydsharif19@gmail.com.

**Thank you for taking the time to read my README, and I hope to hear from you soon!**
